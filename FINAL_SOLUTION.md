# Final Solution: Using SermonCalendar

After addressing several build errors, here is the final solution for implementing the modern calendar design.

## Understanding the Errors

We've resolved the following issues:

1. **"Invalid redeclaration of 'CalendarSection'"** - Eliminated by removing typealiases and using different naming
2. **"Property cannot be declared public because its type uses an internal type"** - Fixed by matching access levels
3. **"Multiple commands produce same output file"** - Fixed by eliminating duplicate implementations

## How to Use SermonCalendar

### Step 1: Add the Implementation File
1. Ensure you have `Letterspace Canvas/Views/Modern/SermonCalendar.swift` in your project
2. Remove any duplicate ModernCalendarSection.swift or Calendar.swift files from your project

### Step 2: Update Your HomeView.swift
Look for the `topContainers` method in HomeView.swift (around line 736) and replace:

```swift
CalendarSection(
    documents: documents,
    calendarDocuments: calendarDocuments
)
```

With:

```swift
SermonCalendar(
    documents: documents,
    calendarDocuments: calendarDocuments
)
```

### Step 3: Clean and Rebuild
1. In Xcode, select Product > Clean Build Folder (Shift+Command+K)
2. Delete DerivedData if needed: `rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/*`
3. Restart Xcode
4. Rebuild your project

## Why This Approach Works

1. **Completely different names** - By using `SermonCalendar` instead of extending or aliasing `CalendarSection`, we avoid name conflicts
2. **Matching access levels** - We ensure all types use the same access level as your model types
3. **No typealiases** - We removed the problematic typealiases
4. **Direct usage** - We don't need to make complex changes to your existing code

## The Modern Calendar Features

The SermonCalendar implementation includes all your requested features:
- Horizontal month slider with visual selection state
- Year picker dropdown menu
- Clean list of active dates with documents
- Modern styling with proper spacing and visual hierarchy

## If Issues Persist

If you still encounter build issues:
1. Double-check that you've removed all duplicate implementations
2. Ensure that `SermonCalendar.swift` is the only implementation file in your project
3. Try moving or creating a copy of SermonCalendar.swift directly in the main project directory
4. Consider creating a new Swift file from scratch with just the basic implementation
