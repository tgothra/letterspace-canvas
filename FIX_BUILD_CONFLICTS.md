# How to Fix the Build Conflicts

The error message you're seeing is due to multiple Swift files containing the same struct name (`ModernCalendarSection`), causing duplicate output files during compilation.

## Actions Taken

We've renamed the duplicate files to avoid conflicts:
- `Views/ModernCalendar.swift` → `Views/ModernCalendar.swift.bak`
- `Views/Calendar/ModernCalendarSection.swift` → `Views/Calendar/ModernCalendarSection.swift.bak`
- `Views/Calendar.swift` → `Views/Calendar.swift.bak`

Now only `Views/Modern/ModernCalendarSection.swift` contains the implementation.

## Steps to Fix the Build in Xcode

1. **Update Xcode Project References**:
   - In Xcode, you may still have references to the renamed files
   - Right-click on any red file references in the navigator and select "Delete"
   - Choose "Remove Reference" (not "Move to Trash")

2. **Clean the Build Folder**:
   - Select Product > Clean Build Folder (Shift+Command+K)
   - This removes cached build files that might still contain references to duplicate implementations

3. **Restart Xcode**:
   - Sometimes a full restart of Xcode is needed to clear all caches

4. **Make Sure These Files are Added to Your Project**:
   - `Views/Modern/ModernCalendarSection.swift`
   - `Views/Modern/CalendarBridge.swift`

5. **Update HomeView.swift**:
   - As described in the INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md, you'll need to update HomeView.swift to use our new implementation

## Understanding the Solution

The core issue was that multiple files were defining the same struct name. Our solution:

1. Keep only one implementation in `Views/Modern/ModernCalendarSection.swift`
2. Use `CalendarBridge.swift` to connect the implementation to your existing code
3. Remove or rename all other implementations

This approach maintains the clean modern calendar design while eliminating the build conflicts.
