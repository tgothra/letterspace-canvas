# Calendar Redesign Summary

## Changes Made

We've completely redesigned the calendar implementation for the sermon scheduler as requested:

1. **Created a new implementation file**: `Letterspace Canvas/Views/Calendar.swift`
   - This contains a modernized `CalendarSection` with the same interface as the original
   - It includes all necessary support structures (MonthButton, DateSection, etc.)

2. **New Calendar Features**:
   - **Horizontal Month Slider**: Modern scrollable month selection with visual indicators
   - **Year Picker**: Clean dropdown menu for year selection
   - **List of Active Dates/Documents**: Focused list showing only dates with scheduled sermons
   - **Improved UI**: Better spacing, styling, and organization for a cleaner interface
   - **Simplified Design**: Removed unnecessary elements for a more focused experience

3. **Previous Changes**:
   - Removed the gray fill from the current date indicator, replacing it with a black circle border
   - Removed the service type function from the list view

## How to Implement the Calendar Redesign

Detailed instructions for implementing the new calendar are in the `INSTRUCTIONS.md` file. Since the codebase is complex and has many interdependencies, we've provided options for manual integration.

## Testing

After implementation, please test the following:
1. Month selection via the horizontal slider
2. Year selection via the dropdown menu
3. Viewing sermon dates in the list view
4. Selecting dates and navigating to documents

## Backups

We've created the following backups:
- `Letterspace Canvas/Views/Calendar_bak.swift` - Backup of our new calendar implementation
- `Letterspace Canvas/Views/HomeView.swift.bak_cal_implementation` - Backup of the original HomeView.swift

## Next Steps

If you would like further modifications or encounter any issues with the implementation, please let us know and we'll be happy to assist.
