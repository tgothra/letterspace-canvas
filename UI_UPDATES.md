# SermonCalendar UI Updates

## Overview

The SermonCalendar UI has been updated to match the design shown in your first screenshot. The new design features a left sidebar for date display, improved typography, and better spacing for a more modern look.

## Key Changes

### 1. Date Display Layout

- **Before**: Date and weekday were shown in a horizontal header above the document list
- **After**: Date and weekday are now displayed in a left sidebar with optimized typography:
  - Day number (e.g., "08") is displayed in 20pt regular weight with leading zeros for single-digit days
  - Weekday (e.g., "Saturday") is displayed below the date number
  - Text sizes are balanced for better visual hierarchy
  - Left column width is optimized for content at 80pt
  - Date column has a perfectly balanced light gray background (98.25% white in light mode, 15% white in dark mode) for just the right amount of visual separation
  - Background extends to full height regardless of content size
  - Day and weekday text are vertically centered in the date column

### 2. Header Title

- **Before**: Component was titled "Sermon Schedule" with domain-specific terminology
- **After**: Changed to "Document Schedule" for more generic, versatile labeling:
  - Creates more flexibility for different types of documents
  - Maintains the same clean typography with InterTight-Medium 16pt font
  - Preserves the calendar icon for visual consistency
  - More appropriate for diverse content management

### 3. Year Picker

- **Before**: Year displayed in the top-right header as a separate element
- **After**: Year now integrated as the first item in the month row:
  - Year button now appears at the start of the month selection row
  - Clear visual separator (vertical line) between year button and months
  - Refined 12pt medium weight font matches month buttons for visual consistency
  - Light background (98.5% white opacity) provides subtle contrast while matching the overall UI aesthetic
  - Distinct border around the year button to ensure visibility
  - Increased vertical padding (6pt) for better touch target
  - Custom number formatter ensures year is displayed without commas or separators
  - Additional spacing after the year button visually separates it from the month selection
  - **Selected years appear in bold black text** in the dropdown menu for clear visual hierarchy
  - Non-selected years use secondary gray text for better distinction

## Implementation Details

These changes were implemented by:

1. Restructuring the DateSection layout from a vertical stack to a horizontal stack with a fixed-width sidebar
2. Updating the document item layout to support two lines of text
3. Adjusting font sizes, weights, and padding throughout the component
4. Adding enhanced borders with context-aware styling (different for selected vs. non-selected states)
5. Creating a helper function to format day numbers with leading zeros
6. Refining the component spacing and alignments
7. Optimizing the left column width for a more compact layout
8. Adding subtle shadows for depth and visual hierarchy
9. Implementing clean, border-only hover effects without background color changes
10. Carefully controlling background colors: gray only for date column, white for document area
11. Using GeometryReader to ensure the date column background fills the full height of each row
